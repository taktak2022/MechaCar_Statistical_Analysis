# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
# MODULE 15: STATISTICS and R

## Overview
Jeremy is 10-Year veteran employee of Autos-R-Us and has just been named as the Primary Analyst of the Data Analytics Team.  He and his team are in charge of the following:
* RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL DATA
* ANALYTICAL VERIFICATION OF CURRENT AUTOMOTIVE SPECIFICATIONS
* STUDY DESIGN OF FUTURE PRODUCT DESIGN

** CHALLENGE **
Jeremy and his team are asked by upper management to review production data for the company's newest prototype, the MechaCar which has not moved into the manufacturing stage as it is hampered by production issues.  Their insights with the analysis may help the manufacturing team graduate the prototype past the production stage.  They are given data on test results from 50 prototype vehicles that use multiple design specifications to do the following:
* DELIVERABLE I: Identify which variables predict the MPG of the MechaCar prototype
* DELIVERABLE II: Determine if the manufacturing process for suspension coils and their weight capacities is consistent by testing different metrics across different lots, centering on the coils' PSI.
* DELIVERABLE III: Given the Population mean of 1500 pounds per square inch, determine if the PSI across all manufacturing lots is statistically different.
* DELIVERABLE IV: Using a statistical study, compare quatifiable aspects of performance of the MechaCar against those of other manufacturers.
